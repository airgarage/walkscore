### Context
Parking lots in high demand areas often have a high Walk Score - it indicates there is a lot going on nearby and many points of interest.

### Your task
Our team wrote a script to determine the walk score of some of our parking locations, but unfortunately it's broken. Identify the issues, fix the script, and help us find the Walk Scores!
